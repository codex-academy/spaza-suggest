# Spaza suggest

Create an app that help Spaza Shops to crowdsource which products to sell in their shops.

Create a web app that allows spaza shop clients to suggest which products spaza shops in a selected area should sell. 

Each Spaza shop is linked to one area. Spaza shops can see the suggested products for their area and then accept product suggestions. Keep records are of suggestions accepted by each Spaza shop.

## Screens to build

Ensure your web app have screens for the following:

* A new client can register and get a login code
* A client can login using their login code
* A logged in client can make product suggestions for a selected area. They can select the area to add a suggestion for. A blank suggestion should not be allowed.
* A client should see all the suggestions that they have made and the area it was made for.

* A Spaza shop owner can create an account linked to one area and get a login code.
* Login using the spaza shop code and display all the suggestions for the area of the spaza shop
* Allow a spaza shop owner to accept any of the suggestions made.
* Show all the accepted suggestions for the logged in spaza shop.

> **Tip:** store the logged in `client` or `spaza shop` details in the Http Session for easy access. Use something like `session.client` and `session.shop` for example - one of these 2 entries should be in the session at any given time.

## Planning

Create paper prototypes of the screens (draw them on paper) that you are planning to create and get them reviewed by a mentor before your start coding. If you are remote get your prototypes reviewed view zoom call/email.

Create a Kanban board and share your planning with us at `mentors@projectcodex.co`.

We will email you a feedback request form where you should submit your source and deployed app.

Any other planning instructions will be communicated with your on the day of the assessment. 

## Use the supplied Factory Function

Fork this repo into your GitHub acount. 

Then clone your own version of this repo into your local `project` folder.

Use the supplied factory function in `spaza-suggest.js` in your ExpressJS app.

Create a PostgreSQL database called `spaza_suggest` use the script in `001.db.sql` or do your own database setup.

Run the `002.tables.sql` and `003.areas.sql` scripts to create the tables and to populate the areas in the database. You can add your own areas if you want. Just don't remove the areas that is already in `003.areas.sql` the unit tests are depening on them.

Run these commands to install all dependencies & to run the tests

```
npm install
npm test
```

All the tests should pass if you ran the db scripts correctly.

Don't start creating the web app if your tests are not passing. Get assistance & clarification if needed from the `mentors@projectcodex.co` before potentially blindly proceeding.

Create an `index.js` file for your ExpressJS web app.
